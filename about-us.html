          used
          for referring the peak of the Jum field. In due honor to the culture and tradition of local ethnic
          communities,
          Rainya Tugun was adopted as a brand name in the field of tourism and hospitality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rainya Tugun Eco Resort was initiated in the mid of 2009 by SAS, a local NGO works in Rangamati. Initially,
          SAS shouldered lion share of cost for

          company formed and officially
          incorporated under national laws at similar name in 2020 under the management of SAS and the properties was
          taken lease by the Company, as an
          project, under an particular agreement of sharing resources and Ownership, for rapid development and
          operation. A group of renowned personalities
          from community development background and civil society were comprised as a member of Board of Directors of
          the said Company. Now this company is
          shouldering responsibility of further infrastructural development and business operation of the resort.

          Nature and, caters to a variety of
          travelers and holiday-goers who want to get away from the crowd and find shelter in the nature. however,

        <p>
          Rainya Tugun Eco Resort set forth 3 motto in delivering Services. Such as:
        </p>
        <h4>Responsible Tourism :</h4>
        <p>
          Rainya Tugun Eco Resort will follow 'socially responsible' policy to protect and promote local villager, and
          ensure comfortable visit of Tourist.
          Community will have access to partnering with us and share in its financial success. Interaction between
          villagers and the guest will be made
          with full consent and willing cooperation with a view to accelerate development and community empowerment. The
          resort will also conduct continuous
          consultation for entrepreneurs in the surrounding community to teach them how they can adapt and build
          businesses in expanding tourism market in future.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Environmental Sustainability :</h4>
        <p>
          From the choice of construction materials, to the environmental practices in the resor's operation, Rainya
          Tugun Eco Resort will be designed
          to have minimal reverse impact on environment. The Resort is to be committed to protecting the natural
          heritage of native areas. Instead of trying
          to tame the beautiful setting of our resort area, rather, we are adapting with landscape into our design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Locally available materials like bamboo, wood and others are being used to construct Banglows and structures,
          and old stuff are also used
          to bring additional attraction of resort area. In addition, Preying birds and animals living in the host
          environment is forbidden to any person.
          We use alternative energy, such as solar power, as much as possible.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Volunteerism :</h4>
        <p>
          The central idea of Rainya Tugun Eco Resort was born out from the bottom of love to conserve Community and
          Environment.
          A particular proportion of it financial return would be devoted to the fund of SAS, a local NGO who initiated
          and planned for this resort,
          to run voluntary activities among the communities. Moreover, guests will be able to spend their time for
          volunteering in local community helping
          to build their homes and building skilled and empowered generation.<a href="/index.html"
